## My New Side Hustle: Death 2.0

My sister Tania pointed out:

> Much of what I have been thinking about is live life to the fullest, but perhaps I must add live death to the fullest.

The links below takes you to a message I sent to my friend Ken on this very topic. Ken recently enquired about my well-being.

Ken is one of the few peeps that knows my life both online/in the Matrix and here in the meat-world.

One usually does not get enquiries from online peeps about well-being because in the Matrix everybody is assumed to be of super-human fitness (or a dog).

So I drafted a reply, and as is my custom: why reply with just two or three words when 500+ will do just as well?

I explore what it feels like to be turning seventy, facing imminent death threats and much more.

Or it's an irreverent parody of creating start-ups that prey on geezers.

Or it's just what I felt like writing when I was was writing it.

In any case: long live Death 2.0!

## I am Diana

Started by Theo on Christmas morning 2016.
The title draws from ‘I am Charlie’ or ‘Je suis Charlie’ which in turn draws from ‘Ich bin ein Berliner’ or ‘I am your savior’ and other sources.
The content draws on the manifesto that everything should have a manifesto — including your life.
