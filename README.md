## My New Side Hustle: Death 2.0

My sister Tania pointed out:

> Much of what I have been thinking about is live life to the fullest, but perhaps I must add live death to the fullest.

The links below takes you to a message I sent to my friend Ken on this very topic. Ken recently enquired about my well-being.

Ken is one of the few peeps that knows my life both online/in the Matrix and here in the meat-world.

One usually does not get enquiries from online peeps about well-being because in the Matrix everybody is assumed to be of super-human fitness (or a dog).

So I drafted a reply, and as is my custom: why reply with just two or three words when 500+ will do just as well?

I explore what it feels like to be turning seventy, facing imminent death threats and much more.

Or it's an irreverent parody of creating start-ups that prey on geezers.

Or it's just what I felt like writing when I was was writing it.

In any case: long live Death 2.0!

## I am Diana

Started by Theo on Christmas morning 2016.
The title draws from ‘I am Charlie’ or ‘Je suis Charlie’ which in turn draws from ‘Ich bin ein Berliner’ or ‘I am your savior’ and other sources.
The content draws on the manifesto that everything should have a manifesto — including your life.

## Concept

### Issues / Problems


_The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's et al [A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10._

_Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way_ twice.

_patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome._

There are many issues with death.
The death may not happen at an opportune let a;ome convenient time.
The death of one person may have untoward effects on nearby people.
The death may impede the completion of unfinished business

The solution is to disrupt the process of death so that it becomes timeless, meaningless and eventless


### Mission
_A statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future_

Death 2.0 is an ongoing thought experiment. Possibilities for future endeavors include:

* Catalog the cool things about death
* Examine the life long practice of dying small bits at a time. This might include sending your finger nail clippings to heaven
* A detailed examination of Death 1.0 - including is it better to die before the program begins, during the program or just after


### Vision
_A descriptive picture of a desired future state_

* Death is an interactive, collaborative and virtual experience
* And there's an app for this
